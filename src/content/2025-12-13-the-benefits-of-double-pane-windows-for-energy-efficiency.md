# Introduction to Double-Pane Windows
Double-pane windows, also known as insulated glass units (IGUs), consist of two panes of glass separated by a gap. This design provides excellent thermal insulation, reducing heat transfer and minimizing energy losses.
## How Double-Pane Windows Work
* The gap between the panes is usually filled with air or an inert gas, such as argon or krypton, which acts as an insulator.
* The two panes of glass are sealed together to prevent moisture and air from entering the gap.
* This sealed gap creates a barrier that reduces heat transfer, keeping your home warm in winter and cool in summer.
## Benefits of Double-Pane Windows
* **Energy Efficiency**: Double-pane windows can reduce energy consumption by up to 24% in cold climates and up to 18% in warm climates.
* **Noise Reduction**: The extra pane of glass and the gap between them act as a sound barrier, reducing outside noise.
* **Condensation Reduction**: The sealed gap prevents moisture from entering, reducing the likelihood of condensation and frost on the windows.
## Conclusion
Double-pane windows are an excellent choice for homeowners looking to improve energy efficiency, reduce noise, and minimize condensation. At GlassGo, our expert glaziers can help you install double-pane windows that meet your specific needs and budget.
